			<h3>The Semipalatinsk Test Site or Semipalatinsk-21, also known as "The Polygon.</h3>
			<p> It was the primary testing venue for the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons. A total of 456 nuclear explosions were held at Semipalatinsk test site over four decades. The total explosive yield was 250 times the bomb that razed Hiroshima to the ground in 1945. It is located in Zhanasemey District, Abai Region, Kazakhstan, south of the valley of the Irtysh River</p>

						<p>Around 1.6 million people living in the districts and cities of the Semipalatinsk region and the corresponding districts of the Pavlodar, East Kazakhstan and Karaganda regions are recognized as victims of nuclear tests conducted by the Soviet military-industrial complex from 1949 to 1989.</p>
						<p>People of Semey had no idea that nuclear testings were taking place for the most part of the testing as they were not authorized personel of USSR. The reasoning for their testing with hundreds and thousands of civilians living not to far away from where megatons and kilotons of nuke was being thrown was simply excused by a lying statement of the Soviet scientists that claim there was no one for thousands of kilometers which was not true and the devastation of such cruelty was experienced by the citizens animals or people till now.</p>

						<p>Loud booms, bright flashes of light, and mysteruous mushroom clouds became a regular thing for the residents of Semey/Semipalatinsk. it was said that the effect of the tests were four times worse than of the most famous Chernobyl accident while in Semipalatisks they were done deliberately. The residents of the region believe that place was chosen on purpose in order to study the effects of radiation on people. As a result, the place has the highest rate of cancer, rate of death in youngsters, miscarriages, Down syndrome, birth with diformaties and the worst of all during the testings these diagnoses were not allowed to be linked to radiation by doctors and no other part of Kazakhstan let alone the world had no idea that it was happening!</p>
